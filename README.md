## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
* [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
* [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API (you can use any 3rd party library available to do this).
* [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertController or a 3rd party library to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like.
* [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
* [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
* [ ] Customize the UI. You can use Iconmonstr and The Noun Project as good sources of images.
